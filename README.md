This is an example of a Fibonacci number sequence, the goal of the program is to find the nth number of the sequence
The sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..
define the function fibonacci()
because n can be different values, so it is important to use if loop to fit different situations
